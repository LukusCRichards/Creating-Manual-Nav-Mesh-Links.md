# Making an AI move on the Nav Mesh in Unity.md
This is a tutorial on how to make an AI move to an area you click on in the Nav Mesh

After starting up a 3D Unity project, create a C# script and give it an applicable name, such as **AI Controller**. When you have created it, open it and delete the **System.Collections** and **System.Collections.Generic** code at the top, but keep the using **UnityEngine**. Then under the using UnityEngine code, add in **using UnityEngine.AI** as the script will not work without it.
